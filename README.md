# CONNECT 4 GAME
AUTHOR:- Aryan Pandey 

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect 4 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which the players choose a color and take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does.

## How to Play
1) Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2) Two players take turns, one using the red discs and the other using the yellow discs.
3) Click on the column where you want to drop your disc. The disc will fall to the lowest available position in the column.
4) The game will continue until one of the players successfully connects four discs of their color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or the grid is filled, resulting in a draw.
5) The game ends when a player wins, and you can start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button.
